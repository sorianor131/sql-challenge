Module 9 Homework Assignment - SQL Challenge

## Challenge
For this challenge we were tasked with designing tables to hold data from the CSV files that were provided, import the CSV files into an SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. 

This assignment was broken into three parts: 
* Data Modeling
* Data Engineering
* Data Analysis

## Data Modeling
Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. We used QuickDBD to create our sketch.

## Data Engineering
Use the provided information to create a table schema for each CSV file. Once the tables have been created, import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

## Data Analysis
Use the data to answer the following questions:

1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
